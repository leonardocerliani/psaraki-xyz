## Selecting min session start and purchase in each user/day

```sql
WITH min_purchase AS (
  SELECT
    event_date,
    user_pseudo_id,
    MIN(event_timestamp) AS min_purchase_timestamp
  FROM
    `turing_data_analytics.raw_events`
  WHERE event_name = 'purchase'
  GROUP BY user_pseudo_id, event_date
),
min_session_start AS (
  SELECT    user_pseudo_id,
    MIN(event_timestamp) AS min_session_start_timestamp
  FROM
    `turing_data_analytics.raw_events`
  WHERE
    event_name = 'session_start'
  GROUP BY user_pseudo_id, event_date
)
SELECT
  p.user_pseudo_id,
  parse_date('%Y%m%d',p.event_date) as event_date,
  -- p.min_purchase_timestamp,
  -- s.min_session_start_timestamp
  format_timestamp('%T', timestamp_micros(s.min_session_start_timestamp)) as first_session_start,
  format_timestamp('%T', timestamp_micros(p.min_purchase_timestamp)) as first_purchase,
FROM
  min_purchase p JOIN min_session_start s 
  ON p.user_pseudo_id = s.user_pseudo_id AND p.event_date = s.event_date
order by user_pseudo_id, event_date
```
    

## Rationale for feature gathering 

- In the data we will analyse we want to have as **primary key** the combination of user_pseudo_info and event_date.

- Also we want to catch information about events that happen only between the earliest session_start and the earliest purchase

- Many information are already in the row containing purchase events, however other information we might want to retrieve are in rows with other event names. For instance, we want to count the number of event between the earliest session_start and the earliest purchase, e.g. page_view or scroll

To deal with these requirement we proceed as follows:

We enforce our primary key by grouping by user_pseudo_id and event_date, as well as by min_session_start and min_purchase. This is because we _already_ choose the latter two in the initial CTEs and placed them into two separate columns, therefore there is only one row for each user containing these two information

```sql
/*
    Query to extract session length data from the Google Merchandise Store.
    For each user and date, the session of interested was defined by the 
    first session_start event and the first purchase event of that day.

    Various other features are also extracted and later saved in a csv file
    with the aim of conducting an analysis of session length and its association
    with other interesting feature (e.g. total due in US$)
*/

select
	t1.user_pseudo_id,
	parse_date('%Y%m%d', t1.event_date) as event_date,
	t1.min_session_start_timestamp,
	t2.min_purchase_timestamp,
	-- ...
	group by t1.user_pseudo_id, t1.event_date, t1.min_session_start_timestamp, t2.min_purchase_timestamp
```

Then we limit the information we catch between the boundaries of the earliest session_start and the earliest purchase. This is achieved with the final `where` clause.

**NB: we also enforce that the earliest purchase should occur *****after***** the earliest session_start, so that we avoid catching events in a session that was started before the midnight of the day before** 

```sql
where t2.min_purchase_timestamp > t1.min_session_start_timestamp 
  and (mt.event_timestamp >= t1.min_session_start_timestamp and mt.event_timestamp <= t2.min_purchase_timestamp) 
```

**At this point we are free to select from any of the available events withing the time boundaries,** simply by using an aggregation on a `case when`. For instance:

```sql
# selects the campaign in the event_name "purchase". Note that it is a string, so we want to use the MAX aggregation
max(case when event_name = "purchase" then mt.campaign else NULL end) as campaign,
```

An interesting case is when we want to retrieve an information which is ****not**** in either the session_start or purchase event. For instance, we want to know whether the items added to the cart come from the Sale page - hence with discounted price - or from one of the specific categories (e.g. Apparel) - hence without discount. Therefore in this case we need to look into events with name add_to_cart

```sql
sum(case when (event_name = "add_to_cart" and page_title like "%Sale%") then 1 else 0 end) as is_on_sale,
```

Importantly, now we can count the events for each event_name, for instance:

```sql
sum(case when event_name = "scroll" then 1 else 0 end) as n_scrolls,
sum(case when event_name = "add_payment_info" then 1 else 0 end) as n_add_payment_info,
sum(case when event_name = "add_shipping_info" then 1 else 0 end) as n_add_shipping_info,
sum(case when event_name = "begin_checkout" then 1 else 0 end) as n_begin_checkout,
```
